        The Golden Temple, also known as Harmandir Sahib, is one of the most
        revered spiritual sites in India and a symbol of the Sikh faith. Located
        in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, it is a magnificent structure built around
        a pool of holy water, which pilgrims bathe in as part of their spiritual
        journey. The temple is renowned for its stunning golden facade and the
        serene environment that surrounds it.

        The Golden Temple was originally built in 1581 by the fourth Sikh Guru, Guru Ram Das.
        It has undergone multiple renovations over the centuries, with the golden plating being added
        by Maharaja Ranjit Singh in the 19th century. The temple is a blend of Indo-Saracenic, Mughal, and
        Persian architectural styles. Its significance goes beyond architectureâ€”it represents equality,
        unity, and the central teachings of Sikhism.
