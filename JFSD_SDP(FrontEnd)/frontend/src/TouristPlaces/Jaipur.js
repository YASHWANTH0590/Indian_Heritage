        Jaipur, also known as the "Pink City," is the capital of the Indian state of Rajasthan. It is a city known for its vibrant culture, rich history, and architectural wonders. Jaipur was founded in 1727 by Maharaja Jai Singh II, the ruler of Amber, and is named after him. It was designed according to principles of Vastu Shastra, the traditional Indian system of architecture, with a focus on symmetry and alignment. The city was painted pink in 1876 to welcome the Prince of Wales, and since then, it has maintained its distinct color, which adds to its charm.
